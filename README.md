# trafficPredictionAI
This project leverages the UK Road Traffic Statistics dataset to develop a GeoAI-powered traffic analysis and prediction tool. The application uses machine learning models to predict future traffic patterns based on historical data and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API to automate the generation of traffic insights.

# ToDo List for GeoAI-Traffic-Prediction

## 1. Setup Project Structure
- [ ] Create the GitHub repository with a clear project description
- [ ] Set up the initial project directory as per the project structure
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive data (e.g., API keys)

## 2. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- [ ] Download UK Road Traffic Statistics dataset
- [ ] Create `data_processing.py` to clean, preprocess, and aggregate traffic data
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in `data_exploration.ipynb`
- [ ] Store the processed data in `data/processed/` folder

## 3. Predictive Modeling
- [ ] Build a traffic prediction model using historical traffic data
- [ ] Test different machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, time series)
- [ ] Store trained models and checkpoints in `models/` folder
- [ ] Log training metrics and results with MLflow (`mlflow_logging.py`)

## 4. GPT-4 Integration for Insights
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API in `gpt_integration.py` for automated traffic insights
- [ ] Create prompts for GPT-4 to generate human-readable insights based on traffic data
- [ ] Implement GPT integration to generate insights based on model predictions

## 5. Build the Dashboard
- [ ] Build a Streamlit or Flask app in `app.py` to display traffic predictions
- [ ] Implement file upload feature for users to input traffic data
- [ ] Display data trends and predictions using charts and maps (e.g., road network)
- [ ] Integrate GPT-generated insights into the dashboard

## 6. MLOps (MLflow) Integration
- [ ] Set up MLflow for experiment tracking (model parameters, metrics, logs)
- [ ] Log different versions of models and predictions for reproducibility
- [ ] Save trained models and results for further use or deployment

## 7. Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Test the dashboard functionality with sample traffic data
- [ ] Ensure accurate predictions and meaningful GPT-4 insights
- [ ] Deploy the dashboard locally or to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS)

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] Write a detailed `README.md` explaining the project, setup instructions, and usage
- [ ] Document the API configuration and model architecture
- [ ] Create usage instructions for the dashboard, including input formats and outputs

## 9. Finalize and Push to GitHub
- [ ] Push all project files, scripts, and documentation to GitHub
- [ ] Ensure the project is well-documented and ready for public access
- [ ] Add a license file (MIT or GPL) to the repository
