# trafficPredictionAI
This project leverages the UK Road Traffic Statistics dataset to develop a GeoAI-powered traffic analysis and prediction tool. The application uses machine learning models to predict future traffic patterns based on historical data and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API to automate the generation of traffic insights.
